<h2>How to Breed Corydoras Catfish</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Corydoras Catfish (cory or cories for short) are popular fishes in the aquarium hobby. There are a lot of varities <br />
    of cories with different colors but all of them have similar body shape and "whiskers" at the front. Although,<br /> 
    most cory catsfish can be bred in the aquarium, some can be bred with little effort while others require a great<br />
    deal of attention, work, and sometimes luck, to be sucessful. 
</p>
<h3>Steps in Breeding Corydoras</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Transfer adult male and female cories into a breeding tank. Ideal ratio is 3 males for every female.</li>
    <li>Feed them with live food, like daphnia, baby brine shrimp, live worms (Grindal worms, Tubifex worms, White worms), etc.<br />
    (Note: In the absence of live foods, High protien pellets or dried food can be used)</li>
    <li>Do 20-25% water changes daily or every two days, for a week. This will encourage them to spawn.</li>
    <li>When the breeders start to spawn (usually early in the morning), collect the eggs and transfer them to a hatching tank.</li>
    <li>The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days. Feed the fry with baby brine shrimp or infusoria, on the second day.</li>
</ol>
